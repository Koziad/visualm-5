        The Material Sample Management Tool is a label generator
        and database to support creative communities in documenting
        and sharing material experiments. It was designed around the
        idea of collaboratively building an archive of alternative design
        materials with an emphasis on materials that are easily
        renewable, reusable, (home) compostable within 90 days,
        locally abundant and make use of local waste streams. The
        open-source tool, which functions as a collaborative archive as
        well as label generator to help showcase material experiments,
        was developed to help any community of creatives (especially
        students) share them with peers online and offline, and
        showcase them the physical material wall in their shared
        workspaces, studios and tool shops.

        This tool is part of a larger material archiving project funded by
        NWO by means of a Comenius Teaching Fellowship awarded
        to senior lecturer and researcher Loes Bogers. In close
        collaboration with Textile Lab Amsterdam at Waag, a dedicated
        project team consisting of design educators, researchers and
        partners at Waag will develop archiving tools for sharing
        research into sustainable design materials in higher education.
        The project is inspired by, and a continuation of the Material
        Archive developed at Waag by Cecilia Raspanti, Maria Viftrup
        and other (2017-2019). The project will run until January 2022.

          <h2>What are the sustainability tags? How do you define them?</h2>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p> • Made of <i>renewable</i> resources means that the resources used
          take less than a human lifetime to replenish, but preferably
          shorter than that</p>
        <p>  • <i> Home compostable</i> means that the final material can be fully
          composted into fertilizer without special conditions (heat,
          mechanical processing) in less than 90 days. See also:
          https://www.milieucentraal.nl/in-en-om-het-huis/tuinieren/t
          uinonderhoud/zelf-composteren/</p>
        <p>  • Materials are <i> reusable </i> when they can be reshaped without
          quality loss, requiring very little additional resources: for
          example by heating and recasting it, or by reversing a
          chemical reaction.</p>
        <p>  • If the ingredients used can largely be sourced as a by-product
          from something else, or from a waste stream the material
          qualifies for the tag: <i>by-product</i> or waste.</p>
        <p>  • We say a material is <i>vegan</i>, when the sourcing of its
          ingredients is not related to activities involving
          animal-cruelty of any kind.</p>
        <p>  • And lastly: when ingredients used are locally sourced and
          produced (locally or in neighbouring countries, or within
          500 km), we can say its <i>locally abundant</i>.</p>

          <h2>What can you do with this tool? </h2>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
       <p> • Make an account and document DIY material experiments on
         the go (only @hva.nl email addresses)</p>
        <p>  • Store drafts, and publish them when you are ready to share a
        physical sample in the lab</p>
        <p>  • Generate a PDF label in A6, A5, or A4 size and attach it to
        your material sample to showcase it in the Makers Lab</p>
        <p> • Browse and study samples made by your peers, either
        physically in the lab, or online</p>
        <p> • Not an AUAS student or employee? Contact Loes Bogers for
        a guest account: l.bogers@hva.nl</p>

      <p>I want to use this tool in my class, can you give a
        talk/workshop? Can I become an admin too?</p>
      <br>
      <p>Sure! Contact Loes Bogers at <a href="mailto:l.bogers@hva.nl">l.bogers@hva.nl</a> for more info.</p>
      <br />

      <p>I don’t have an AUAS email address because I work or study
        somewhere else, can I get an account?</p>
      <br>
      <p>Contact Loes Bogers at <a href="mailto:l.bogers@hva.nl">l.bogers@hva.nl</a> to request a guest
        account. Or get in touch with the systems admin at your own

        downloaded from Github. You may host your own material
        sample management tool, modify the accepted email domain
        and organisation logo and start hosting your own material
        archive. You are even free to remix or adapt the work to fit your
        needs: <a href="https://github.com/Koziad/visualm-5" >https://github.com/Koziad/visualm-5</a>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>We would love to hear from you if you are hosting your own,
        and find out how you like it!</p>
